altera-auto-build
=================

This is a fairly comprehensive build system that allows for simulation and synthesis of verilog on Altera FPGAs. Assumes simulation is Mentor Graphics ModelSim and synthesis is done completely in Quartus. Underlying scripts use python 3 and make. Works on both cygwin and linux.
